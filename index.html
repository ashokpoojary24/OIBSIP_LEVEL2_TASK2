          <h2>Father of Indian Nuclear Programme</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Homi Jehangir Bhabha,</b> FRS (30 October 1909 – 24 January 1966) was an Indian nuclear physicist 
            who is widely credited as the "father of the Indian nuclear programme". He was the founding director 
            and professor of physics at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), as well as the founding 
            director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) which was renamed the Bhabha Atomic Research
             Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET served as the cornerstone of the Indian nuclear energy and weapons programme.
              He was the first chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy. 
              By supporting space science projects which initially derived their funding from the AEC, he played an important role in 
              the birth of the Indian space programme. He was awarded the Adams Prize (1942) and Padma Bhushan (1954), and nominated for 
              the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953–1956. He died in the crash of Air India Flight 101 in 1966, at the age of 56.
